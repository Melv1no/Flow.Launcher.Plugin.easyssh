Flow.Launcher.Plugin.easyssh
==================

A plugin for the [Flow launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher).

Currently, this plugin enables you to establish an SSH connection using a single command line. In the future, I plan to integrate a NoSQL database to store various SSH connection profiles.

### Usage

    ssh <arguments>
